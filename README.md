# HMCTS Task Manager Challenge

A simple task management system built for the HMCTS developer challenge. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks with a clean and user-friendly interface that prioritises accessibility, usability, and security.

This project was built using **Next.js** with **Tailwind CSS**, **Shadcn UI**, and **React Hook Form** for the frontend, and **Laravel API** with **PostgreSQL** for the backend. It follows best practices in test-driven development (TDD), modern software architecture, and accessible design principles inspired by the GOV.UK Design System.

## üß™ API Endpoints

**Use curl to test the endpoints**

> Replace localhost:8000 with your backend URL if hosted elsewhere and ensure it is on the same domain as the frontend to avoid CORS issues.

**Create a task**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Test Task", "description": "This is a test task", "status": "pending", "due_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000000Z"}'
```

- `POST /api/tasks` ‚Äì create a task

**Sample request body:**

```json
{
  "title": "Test Task",
  "description": "This is a test task",
  "status": "pending",
  "due_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

**Sample response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Test Task",
    "description": "This is a test task",
    "status": "pending",
    "due_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000000Z"
  }
}
```

**List all tasks**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/tasks
```

- `GET /api/tasks` ‚Äì list all tasks

**Sample response:**

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Test Task",
      "description": "This is a test task",
      "status": "pending",
      "due_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Get a single task**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/1
  -H "Accept: application/json"
```

- `GET /api/tasks/{id}` ‚Äì get a single task

**Sample response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Test Task",
    "description": "This is a test task",
    "status": "pending",
    "due_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000000Z"
  }
}
```

**Update a task**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "Updated Task", "description": "This is an updated task", "status": "in_progress", "due_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000000Z"}'
```

  "due_date": "2024-12-31T00:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

**Delete a task**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/1
